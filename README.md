| [cleaner.py](https://github.com/GIQSubmission/R2G/blob/master/src/helper/textcleaner/cleaner.py) | This code snippet is part of the parent repository's architecture and is located at src/helper/textcleaner/cleaner.py. It defines a class called Cleaner that provides various text cleaning functions for different data sources such as Telegram, Twitter, and Google News. These functions include removing URLs, cleaning multilingual text, correcting spelling mistakes, removing emojis, and more. The class can be instantiated with arguments specifying the input file or folder, the data type, and the output file or folder. The run_all method runs the appropriate cleaning function based on the specified data type. |
